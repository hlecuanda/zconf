keybase-git-pgp

   this is an adapter program that enables using keybase instead of
   pgp when signing commits. it just homologates the expected inputs
   and outputs from git. it should be enabled thusly:

      # git config --global gpg.program "/home/hector/bin/keybase-git-pgp"

   you can do this by running

      # keybase-git-pgp -c

usage:

      # keybase-git-pgp [options]

options:
      -c : configure git to use this adapter

   When installed the adapter will behave identically to
   gpg --verify  - <  # when verifying
   gpg -bsau  < cat -            # when signing

see also:

   # man git config gpg.program
