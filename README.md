# zconf

So there i was, tweaking my custom keybindings for `zsh`, so i could invoke `thefuck` just by hitting <kbd>Control</kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>F</kbd>, when I realized i had spent more time tweaking the `.dotfiles ` rather than doing *any actual work*, and then it hit me: it must be a franework! i should share its awesomness with the world!

some features:
* [ ] `make` automated, no need to download half the internet so yo can `npm somethubg`
* [ ] sets up and installs what I think is a kick-ass lightweight text-based zsh-centered, prezto-enhanced, tmux-multiplexed environment suitable for sysadmin, devops or devel work, using native packages on all supported platforms

* [ ] Uses spf13-vim enhanced plugin distributions so your vim is fully loaded and pimped out with all the bling bling to make everyone think yo've got madd vim skillz

* [ ] Zsh configured with an unobtrusive prompt, plus the prezto config framework already config'd with all the good parts and none of the digging, plus  a bunch of my own documented keybindings and awesome widgets found all over the net during the last 15 years of using zsh for everthing, even making coffee

* [ ] keeps my environment up-to date and in sync, natively on FreeBSD, Linux (Ubuntu, Debian and Google's cloud-shell), a fleet of Raspberry-pi devices and my trusty AndroidOne Nokia 6 (Almost as good as my beloved Nexus 4, rest it's soul)

[  ] other stuff that ill write later.
